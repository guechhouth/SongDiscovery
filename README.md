# Web Development Project 4 - Random Song Generator

This web app: This app allows the user to discover random songs 

## Required Features
- Fetch & Display: Button triggers an API request from Apple Music and displays one result at a time, including at least three attributes and an image.
- Randomized Results: Each button click provides a seemingly random new result.
- Ban List (Toggle): Clicking on an attribute adds the song to a ban list; clicking again removes it.
- Filtered Results: Banned attributes prevent matching results from appearing in future API calls.
- Result History: A session-based history records all previously displayed results (images + attributes).
